# Ian Abiel Wangsa — Personal Portfolio

A Next.js 15 App Router portfolio with Ian’s original green, five-tab layout: Profile, Projects, Experience, Skills and Awards.

Live site: https://manutd1234.github.io/Personal-Website/

## Stack and interactions

- TypeScript, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, Framer Motion and Lucide icons.
- Original large-name hero, taped real portrait, green navigation and painterly accents.
- Interactive role roll, bounded Matter.js skill playground, keyboard nudges and reset.
- Filtered project cards with uniform 16:10 previews, equal grid rows, all source links and private-access labels.
- Expandable experience rows, education bullet lists, community/service archive and certificate links.
- Gym, travel, good food and learning cards using the existing real photographs; the illustrative gym photograph retains its attribution.
- Copy-email feedback, light/dark themes, visible focus states and reduced-motion support.

## Run locally

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The development site serves at http://127.0.0.1:3000. The scripts call Node entrypoints directly because this checkout’s parent path contains a colon.

## Production checks

```sh
npm run typecheck
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/Personal-Website npm run build
```

The production static export is generated in `out/`. GitHub Actions builds with `/Personal-Website` as the base path and deploys `out/` to the existing GitHub Pages site. Images are pre-optimized WebP assets, with explicit dimensions or reserved aspect ratios. There are no runtime server or external API requirements.

For a standalone root-hosted preview, run `npm run build` without the base-path variable, then `npm run preview` and open http://127.0.0.1:8766.
